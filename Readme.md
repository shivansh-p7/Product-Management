## System Overview

The E-Commerce Backend is built using Node.js, a popular JavaScript runtime environment. It utilizes Express.js, a web application framework, to handle HTTP requests and provide the necessary endpoints for E-Commerce operations.

The system includes features such as:

- **Products**: Management of product catalog, including creation, retrieval, update, and deletion of products.
- **Customers**: Management of customer accounts, including registration, login, and profile updates.
- **Orders**: Placement and retrieval of orders, order history, and order management.
- **Payments**: Integration with payment gateways to handle secure payment processing.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: User authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to the API endpoints.

## Installation

To install and run the E-Commerce Backend, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd e-commerce-backend
   ```

4. Install the dependencies using npm:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

5. Configure the environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and set the following variables:

   ```dotenv
   PORT=<port-number>
   DATABASE_URL=<database-url>
   JWT_SECRET=<jwt-secret-key>
   ```

   Replace `<port-number>` with the desired port number for the server, `<database-url>` with the URL for your database, and `<jwt-secret-key>` with a secret key for JSON Web Token (JWT) generation and verification.

6. Run the server:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start running on the specified port.

## Usage

Once the server is up and running, you can use a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com) or any HTTP client to interact with the E-Commerce Backend.

Here are some sample use cases:

- **Products**
  - Create a new product by sending a POST request to `/api/products` with the required product details in the request body.
  - Update an existing product by sending a PUT request to `/api/products/:id` with the product ID in the URL and the updated product details in the request body.
  - Delete a product by sending a DELETE request to `/api/products/:id` with the product ID in the URL.

- **Customers**
  - Register a new customer account by sending a POST request to `/api/customers/register` with the required customer details in the request body.
  - Log in to a customer account by sending a POST request to `/api/customers/login` with the customer credentials in the request body.
  - Update the customer profile by sending a PUT request to `/api/customers/:id` with the customer ID in the URL and the updated profile details in the request body.

- **Orders**
  - Place a new order by sending a POST request to `/api/orders` with the required order details in the request body.
  - Retrieve order history for a customer by sending a GET request to `/api/orders` with the
  - customer ID in the URL.

- **Authentication and Authorization**
  - User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Upon successful login, the server generates a JWT that should be included in the headers of subsequent requests for authentication purposes.

Feel free to explore the available API endpoints documented below for more information on the available routes and request/response formats.
